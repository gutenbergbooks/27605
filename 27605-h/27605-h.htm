<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>BURTON'S "ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY."</h3>

  <p>In this age of "new editions," it is a wonder that no one has favoured
  the public with a reprint, with notes <i>variorum</i>, of this celebrated
  English classic.</p>

  <p>Dr. Dibdin, in a note to his edition of More's <i>Utopia</i>, vol. ii.
  p. 97., says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Whoever will be at the trouble of consulting Part II, sect. <span
  class="scac">IV.</span> memb.. i. subsect. 4. of the last folio edition
  of Burton [1676], will see how it varies from the first folio of 1624;
  and will, in consequence, regret the omission of the notice of these
  variations in the octavo editions of Burton recently published."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The octavo editions here referred to are those of 1800 and 1806; the
  latter, I believe, edited by Edward Du Bois. The folio of 1676 is, in all
  probability, an exact reprint of that of 1651, which certainly differs
  considerably from those of an earlier date. Henry Cripps, the publisher
  of the edition of 1651, has the following notice:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">"<i>To the Reader.</i></p>

  <p>Be pleased to know (courteous Reader) that since the last impression
  of this Book, the ingenuous author of it is deceased, leaving a copy of
  it exactly corrected, with several considerable additions by his own
  hand. This copy he committed to my care and custody, with directions to
  have those additions inserted in the next edition; which, in order to his
  command and the publicke good, is faithfully performed in this last
  impression.</p>

  <p class="author">H. C."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Modern writers have been deeply indebted to old Robert Burton; but he,
  in his turn, was equally indebted to earlier writers. Dr. Dibdin
  remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I suspect that Burton, the author of the <i>Anatomy of
  Melancholy</i>, was intimately acquainted with Boiastuan's book as
  translated by Alday; for there are passages in Burton's 'Love Melancholy'
  (the most extraordinary and amusing part of his work), which bear a very
  strong resemblance to many in the 'Gests and Countenances ridiculous of
  Lovers,' at p. 195 of Boiastuan's <i>Theatre, or Rule of the
  World</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The title of the curious book mentioned in this extract is&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Theatrum Mundi. Theatre, or Rule of the World: Wherein may bee seene
  the running Race and Course of everie Mannes Lyfe, as touching Miserie
  and Felicitie: whereunto is added a learned Worke of the excellencie of
  Man. Written in French by Peter Boiastuan. Translated by John Alday.
  Printed by Thomas East, for John Wright, 8vo. 1582."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But Burton was more indebted to another work, very similar in title
  and matter to his own; I mean Dr. Bright's curious little volume, of
  which I transcribe the title-page in full:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Treatise of Melancholy: contayning the Causes thereof, and reasons
  of the strange Effects it worketh in our Minds and Bodies; with the
  Phisicke Cure, and Spirituall Consolation for such as have thereto
  adjoyned afflicted Conscience. The difference betwixt it and Melancholy,
  with diverse philosophical Discourses touching Actions, and Affections of
  Soule, Spirit, and Body: the Particulars whereof are to be seene before
  the Booke. By T. Bright, Doctor of Phisicke. Imprinted at London by John
  Windet, sm. 8vo. 1586."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It has been remarked that Burton does not acknowledge his obligations
  to Bright. This, however, is not strictly true, as the former
  acknowledges <i>several quotations</i> in the course of his work. It
  would certainly be desirable, in the event of a new edition of the
  <i>Anatomy</i>, that a comparison of the two books should be made. As a
  beginning towards this end, I subjoin a table of the contents of Bright's
  <i>Treatise</i>, with a notice of some similar passages in Burton's
  <i>Anatomy</i>, arranged in parallel columns.</p>

  <p>I may just add, that Bright's <i>Treatise</i> consists of 276 pages,
  exclusive of a dedication "To the Right Worshipful M. Peter Osborne,"
  &amp;c. (dated from "Little S. Bartlemews by Smithfield, the 13 of May,
  1586"); and an address "To his Melancholick Friend M."</p>

  <p>All that is known of his biography has been collected by the Rev.
  Joseph Hunter, and communicated to the last edition of Wood's <i>AthenÃ¦
  Oxonienses</i>, vol. ii. p. 174. <i>note</i>.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM LYON, BISHOP OF CORK, CLOYNE, AND
ROSS.</h3>

  <p>It is very generally believed that Dr. William Lyon (not Lyons, as he
  is sometimes called) was originally in the navy; that having
  distinguished himself in several actions against the Spaniards, he was
  promised by Queen Elizabeth the first crown appointment that should be
  vacant; and that this happening to be the see of Cork, he was appointed
  to it. This is mentioned in other works as well as in Mr. Crofton
  Croker's very agreeable <i>Researches in the South of Ireland</i>, p.
  248.; and I have more than once heard it given as a remarkable instance
  of church preferment. <!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page193"></a>{193}</span></p>

  <p>Sir James Ware informs us that Bishop Lyon was Vicar of Naas in 1573,
  Vicar of Brandanston in 1580, and chaplain to Lord Grey, who was sent to
  Ireland as Lord Deputy in September, 1580. This is inconsistent with the
  statement, that Queen Elizabeth took him from the quarter-deck to make
  him a bishop, inasmuch as he was in holy orders, and in possession of
  preferment in Ireland, nearly ten years before he was raised to the
  highest order in the ministry. If, therefore, he was ever distinguished
  for gallantry in naval warfare, it must have been before 1573; for we
  have no reason to suppose that the Rev. George Walker, the hero of
  Londonderry, had him as an example. But, as no action with the Spaniards
  could have taken place prior to 1577, how is this to be reconciled with
  the common account, that his gallantry against them attracted the notice
  of the queen? In a miscellaneous compilation, entitled <i>Jefferson's
  Selections</i> (published in York in 1795, and indebted for its
  information about Lyon to an old newspaper, which gave oral tradition as
  its sole authority), we are told that his picture, in the captain's
  uniform, the left hand wanting a finger, is still to be seen in the
  bishop's palace at Cork. The picture is there, and represents him
  certainly as wanting a finger; he is dressed, however, not in a captain's
  uniform, but in a very scholar-like black gown.</p>

  <p>I know not how Mr. Croker could have given the year 1606 as the date
  of his appointment to the see of Cloyne, for we learn from Ware, who is
  no mean authority, that he was first appointed to the see of Ross in
  1582; that the sees of Cork and Cloyne were given to him <i>in
  commendam</i> in 1583 (as is recorded in the Consistorial Court of Cork),
  and that the three sees were formally united in his person in 1586.</p>

  <p>In 1595 he was appointed one of the commissioners to consider the best
  means of peopling Munster with English settlers, and of establishing a
  voluntary composition throughout that province in lieu of cess and taxes;
  this does not look as if he had been an illiterate captain of a ship, or
  one of those "rude-bred soldiers, whose education was at the
  musket-mouth." In fact, Ware does not seem to have considered him
  remarkable for anything except such qualities as well became his order.
  And we have the high testimony of Archbishop Bramhall (quoted by Ware),
  that "Cork and Ross fared the best of any bishoprick in that province, a
  very good man, Bishop Lyon, having been placed there early in the
  Reformation."</p>

<h3>CURIOUS MARRIAGE AGREEMENT.</h3>

  <p>The original of the following paper is in existence in this city:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To <span class="sc">Mrs. Deborah Leaming</span>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"Madam.&mdash;Seeing I, Jacob Sprier, have addressed myself to you
  upon the design of marriage, I therefore esteem it necessary to submit to
  your consideration some particulars, before we enter upon that solemn
  enterprise which may either establish our happiness or occasion our
  inquietude during life, and if you concur with those particulars, I shall
  have great encouragement to carry my design into execution; and since
  happiness is the grand pursuit of a rational creature, so marriage ought
  not to be attempted short of a prospect of arriving thereat; and in order
  thereto (should we marry) I conceive the following rules and particulars
  ought to be steadily observed and kept, viz.:</p>

  <p>"1st. That we keep but one purse: a severance of interest bespeaking
  diffidence, mistrust, and disunity of mind.</p>

  <p>"2nd. That we avoid anger as much as possible, especially with each
  other; but if either should be overtaken therewith, the other to treat
  the angry party with temper and moderation during the continuance of such
  anger; and afterwards, if need require, let the matter of heat be coolly
  discussed when reason shall resume its government.</p>

  <p>"3rd. As we have different stocks of children to which we are and
  ought to be strongly attached by ties of nature, so it's proper when such
  children or any of them need correction, it be administered by the party
  from whom they have descended; unless, in the opinion of both parties, it
  shall be thought necessary to be otherwise administered for the
  children's good.</p>

  <p>"4th. That no difference or partiality be made with respect to such
  children who live with us in point of common usage touching education,
  food, raiment, and treatment, otherwise than as age, circumstance, and
  convenience may render it necessary, to be agreed upon between us, and
  grounded upon reason.</p>

  <p>"5th. That civility, courtesy, and kind treatment be always exercised
  and extended towards such child or children that now is or hereafter may
  be removed from us.</p>

  <p>"6th. That we use our mutual endeavours to instruct, counsel, improve,
  admonish, and advise all our children, without partiality, for their
  general good; and that we ardently endeavour to promote both their
  temporal and eternal welfare.</p>

  <p>"7th. That each of us use our best endeavours to inculcate upon the
  minds of our respective stocks of children a venerable and honourable
  opinion of the other of us; and avoid as much as possible any insinuation
  that may have a different tendency.</p>

  <p>"8th. That in matters where either of us is more capable of judging
  than the other of us, and best acquainted therein, that the person so
  most capable of judging, and best acquainted, do follow his or her own
  judgment without control, unless the other shall be able to give a
  sufficient reason to the contrary; then, and in such case, the same to be
  conclusive; and that we do adhere to each other in things reasonable and
  expedient <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page194"></a>{194}</span>with a mutual condescension, and also
  advise with and consult each other in matters of importance.</p>

  <p>"9th. That if any misunderstanding should arise, the same be calmly
  canvassed and accommodated between ourselves, without admitting the
  interposition of any other, or seeking a confident to either to reveal
  our mind unto, or sympathise withal upon the occasion.</p>

  <p>"10th. That no suspicious jealousies of any kind whatever be harboured
  in our breasts, without absolute or good circumstantial evidence; and if
  conceived upon proof or strong presumption, the same to be communicated
  to the suspected person, in temper and moderation, and not told to
  another.</p>

  <p>"11th. That we be just, chaste, and continent to each other; and
  should either prove otherwise, that then we separate, notwithstanding the
  most solemn ties to the contrary, unless it shall suit the injured party
  to forgive the injury and continue the coverture; and in case of
  separation, each of us to keep such share of wealth as we were possessed
  of when are came together, if it remains in the same state, as to
  quantum; but if over or under, then in proportion to what we originally
  had.</p>

  <p>"12th. That we neither give into, nor countenance any ill advisers who
  may have a design to mar our happiness, and sow discord between us.</p>

  <p>"13th. That in matters of religious concernment, we be at liberty to
  exercise our sentiments freely without control.</p>

  <p>"14th. That we use our mutual endeavours to increase our affection,
  cultivate our harmony, promote our happiness, and live in the fear of
  God, and in obedience to His righteous laws.</p>

  <p>"15th. That we use the relatives of each other with friendly kindness;
  and that the same be extended to our friends and benefactors, mutually,
  without grudging.</p>

  <p>"16th. That the survivor of us endeavour, after the death of either of
  us, to maintain the reputation and dignity of the deceased, by avoiding
  levity of behaviour, dissoluteness of life and disgraceful marriage; not
  only so, but that such survivor persevere in good offices to the children
  of the deceased, as a discreet, faithful, and honourable survivor ought
  to do.</p>

  <p>"17th. That in case Jacob Sprier, after trial, shall not think it for
  his interest, or agreeable to his disposition, to live at the plantation
  where Deborah Leaming now resides, then, and in such case, she to remove
  with him elsewhere upon a prospect promising to better his circumstances
  or promote his happiness, provided the landed interest of the said
  Deborah's late husband be taken proper care of for the benefit of her son
  Christopher.</p>

  <p>"18th. That the said Jacob Sprier be allowed from time to time to
  purchase such books from our joint stock as he shall think necessary for
  the advantage and improvement of himself and our children jointly, or
  either of them, without grudging.</p>

  <p>"19th. That the said Jacob Sprier do continue to keep Elisha Hughes,
  and perform his express agreement to him according to indenture already
  executed, and discharge the trust reposed in him the said Sprier by the
  another of the said Elisha, without grudging or complaint.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT AMERICAN LANGUAGES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. vi., pp. 60, 61.)</p>

  <p>Since communicating to you a short list of a few books I had noted as
  having reference to this obscure subject, I have stumbled over a few
  others which bear special reference to the Quichua: and of which I beg to
  send you a short account, which may be worthy a place in your valuable
  pages.</p>

  <p>The first work upon the Quichua language, of which I find mention, is
  a grammar of the Peruvian Indians (<i>Gramatica Ã³ arte general de la
  lengua de los Indios del PerÃ¹</i>), by the brother Domingo de San Thomas,
  published in Valladolid in 1560, and republished in the same year with an
  appendix, being a Vocabulary of the Quichua. The demand for the first
  edition appears to have been considerable; or, what is more likely, from
  the extreme rarity of the work, the careful author <!-- Page 195 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>{195}</span>suppressed or called in
  the first edition, in order to add, for the benefit of his purchasers,
  the vocabulary which he had found time to prepare within the year.</p>

  <p>The work of San Thomas seems to have glutted the market for some
  twenty years; for we do not find that any one made a collection of words
  or grammatical forms until the year 1586, when Antonio Ricardo published
  a kind of introduction to the Quichua, having sole reference to that
  language, without anything more than an explanation in Spanish.<a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> This work, like
  that of his predecessor, was immediately remodelled and re-published in a
  very much extended form in the same year. Ricardo's books are amongst the
  first printed in that part of America.</p>

  <p>Diego de Torres Rubio is the next writer of whom I am cognizant. He
  published at Seville, in 1603, a grammar and vocabulary of the Quichua;
  the subject still continuing to attract attention. Still, as was to be
  expected, the Quichua language was of more consequence to the Spaniards
  of Peru. No doubt, therefore, that Father Juan Martinez found a ready
  sale for his vocabulary, published at Los Reyes in 1604. Indeed, the
  subject is now attracting the attention of the eminent Diego Gonzalez
  Holguin, who published first a new grammar (<i>Gramatica nuevu</i>) of
  the Quichua and Inca dialect, in four books, at the press of Francisco
  del Canto, in Los Reyes, 1607; and second, a vocabulary of the language
  of the whole of Peru (<i>de todo el PerÃ¹</i>), in the same year and at
  the same press.</p>

  <p>It is worthy to remark, as confuting somewhat fully the assertion of
  Prescott (<i>Conquest of Peru</i>, v. ii. p. 188.), that the Spanish name
  of Ciudad de los Reyes ceased to be used in speaking of Lima "within the
  first generation," that the books of Ricardo, Holguin, and Huerta (of
  whom presently) are all stated to have been printed in the Ciudad de los
  Reyes, though the latest of these appeared in 1616. In 1614, however, to
  confine myself strictly to the bibliographical inquiry suggested by the
  heading of my article, a method and vocabulary of the Quichua did appear
  from Canto's press, dated Lima,&mdash;a corruption, as is well known, of
  the word <i>Rimac</i>.</p>

  <p>That, however, the Castilian name should be employed later, is
  curious. At any rate, it occurs for the last time on the title of a work
  printed by the same printer, Canto, in 1616; and written by Don Alonso de
  Huerta, the old title being adhered to, probably from some cause unknown
  to us, but possibly in consequence of old aristocratic opinions and
  prejudices in favour of the Spanish name. That the name of Lima had
  obtained considerably even in the time of the Conquerors, Mr. Prescott
  has sufficiently proved; but as an official and recognised name it
  evidently existed to a later period than the historian has mentioned.</p>

  <p>The work of Torres Rubio, already mentioned, was reprinted in Lima by
  Francisco Lasso in 1619. From this time forward, the subject of the
  native language of Peru seems to have occupied the attention of many
  writers. A quarto grammar was published by Diego de Olmos in 1633 of the
  Indian language, as the Quichuan now came to be called.</p>

  <p>Eleven years later, we find Fernando de Carrera, curate and vicar of
  San Martin de Reque, publishing an elaborate word bearing the following
  title:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Arte de la lengua yunga de los valles del obispado de Truxillo; con
  un confesonario y todas las oraciones cotidianas y otras cosas: Lima, por
  Juan de Contreras, 1644, 16mo."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Grammars and methods here follow thick and fast. A few years after
  Carrera's book, in 1648, comes Don Juan Roxo Mexia y Ocon, <i>natural de
  Cuzco</i>, as he proudly styles himself with a method of the Indian
  language: and after a few insignificant works, again another in 1691, by
  Estevan Sancho de Melgar.</p>

  <p>The most common works on the Quichua are the third and fourth editions
  of Torres Rubio, published at Lima in the years 1700 and 1754. Of these
  two works done with that care and evident pleasure which Jesuits always,
  and perhaps only, bestow upon these difficult by-roads of philology, I
  need say no more, as they are very well known.</p>

  <p>Before I close this communication, allow me to suggest to the readers
  and contributors to the truly valuable "N. &amp; Q.," that no tittle of
  knowledge concerning these early philological researches ought to be
  allowed to remain unrecorded; and with the position which the "N. &amp;
  Q." occupies, and the facilities that journal offers for the preservation
  of these stray scraps of knowledge, surely it would not be amiss to send
  them to the Editor, and let him decide as he is very capable of doing, as
  to their value.</p>

<h3>CONDUITT AND NEWTON</h3>

  <p>In the prospectus of a new <i>Life</i> of sir Isaac Newton, by sir
  David Brewster, it is stated that in examining the papers at Hurstbourne
  Park, the seat of the earl of Portsmouth, the discovery had been maple of
  "copious materials which Mr. Conduit had collected for a life of Newton,
  <i>which had never been supposed to exist</i>."</p>

  <p>About the year 1836 I consulted the principal biographers of
  Newton&mdash;Conduitt, Fontenelle, Birch, Philip Nichols, Thomas Thomson,
  Biot, <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page196"></a>{196}</span>Brewster&mdash;and I have ever since
  believed that such materials <i>did exist</i>.</p>

  <p>We are assured by Mr. Edmund Turnor, in the preface to his <i>History
  of Grantham</i>, printed in 1806, which work is quoted in the prospectus,
  that the manuscripts at Hurstbourne Park then chiefly consisted of some
  pocket-books and memorandums of sir Isaac Newton, and "the information
  obtained by Mr. Conduitt for the purpose of writing his life." Moreover,
  the collections of Mr. Conduitt are repeatedly quoted in that work as
  distinct from the memoirs which were sent to M. de Fontenelle.</p>

  <p>I shall give another anecdote in refutation of the statement made in
  the prospectus, albeit a superfluity. In 1730 the author of <i>The
  Seasons</i> republished his <i>Poem to the memory of sir Isaac
  Newton</i>, with the addition of the lines which follow, and which prove
  that he was aware of the task on which Mr. Conduitt was then occupied.
  The lines, it should be observed, have been omitted in all the editions
  printed since 1738.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"This, <span class="sc">Conduitt</span>, from thy rural hours we hope;</p>
      <p>As through the pleasing shade, where nature pours</p>
      <p>Her every sweet, in studious ease you walk;</p>
      <p>The social passions smiling at thy heart,</p>
      <p>That glows with all the recollected sage."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <i>pleasing shade</i> indicates the grounds of Cranbury-lodge, in
  Hampshire, the seat of Mr. Conduitt&mdash;whose guest the poet seems
  previously to have been.</p>

  <p>Some inedited particulars of the life of Mr. Conduitt, drawn from
  various sources, I reserve for another occasion.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>The Music in Middleton's Tragi-Comedy of the
  "Witch."</i>&mdash;Joseph Ritson, in a letter addressed to J.&nbsp;C. Walker
  (July, 1797), printed in Pickering's edition of Ritson's <i>Letters</i>
  (vol. ii. p. 156.) has the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It may be to your purpose, at the same time, to know that the songs
  in Middleton's <i>Witch</i>, which appear also to have been introduced in
  <i>Macbeth</i>, beginning, 'Hecate, Hecate, come away,' and 'Black
  spirits and white,' have (as I am informed) been lately discovered in MS.
  with the complete harmony, as performed at the original representation of
  these plays. You will find the words in a note to the late editions of
  Shakspeare; and I shall, probably, one of these days, obtain a sight of
  the musick."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The MS. here mentioned was in the collection of the late Mr. J.
  Stafford Smith, one of the Organists of the Chapel Royal. At the sale of
  this gentleman's valuable library it passed, with many other treasures of
  a similar nature, into my possession, where it now remains.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Edward F. Rimbault</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Macaulay and Sir Archibald Alison in error.</i>&mdash;How was
  it that Mr. Macaulay, in two editions of his <i>History</i>, placed the
  execution of Lord Russell on Tower Hill? Did it not take place in
  Lincoln's Inn Fields? And why does Sir A. Alison, in the volume of his
  <i>History</i> just published, speak of the children of Catherine of
  Arragon? and likewise inform us that Locke was expelled from Cambridge?
  Was he not expelled from the University of Oxford?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Abhba</span>.</p>

  <p>"<i>Paid down upon the nail.</i>"&mdash;The origin of this phrase is
  thus stated in the <i>Recollections of O'Keefe</i> the dramatist:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"An ample piazza under the Exchange [in Limerick] was a thoroughfare:
  in the centre stood a pillar about four feet high, and upon it a circular
  plate of copper about three feet in diameter: this was called <i>the
  nail</i>, and on it was paid the earnest for any commercial bargains
  made; which was the origin of saying, 'Paid down upon the nail.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But perhaps the custom, of which Mr. O'Keefe speaks, was common to
  other ancient towns?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Abhba</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Corpulence a Crime.</i>&mdash;Mr. Bruce has written, in his
  <i>Classic and Historic Portraits</i>, that the ancient Spartan paid as
  much attention to the rearing of men as the cattle dealers in modern
  England do to the breeding of cattle. They took charge of firmness and
  looseness of men's flesh; and regulated the degree of fatness to which it
  was lawful, in a free state, for any citizen to extend his body. Those
  who dared to grow too fat, or too soft for military exercise and the
  service of Sparta, were soundly whipped. In one particular instance, that
  of Nauclis, the son of Polytus, the offender was brought before the
  Ephori, and a meeting of the whole people of Sparta, at which his
  unlawful fatness was publicly exposed; and he was threatened with
  perpetual banishment if he did not bring his body within the regular
  Spartan compass, and give up his culpable mode of living; which was
  declared to be more worthy of an Ionian than a son of LacedÃ¦mon.</p>

  <p><i>The Year 1854.</i>&mdash;This year commenced and will terminate on
  a Sunday. In looking through the Almanac, it will be seen that there are
  <i>five Sundays in five months</i> of the year, viz. in January, April,
  July, October, and December; five <i>Mondays</i> in January, May, July,
  and October; five <i>Tuesdays</i> in January, May, August, and October;
  five <i>Wednesdays</i> in March, May, August, and November; five
  <i>Thursdays</i>, in March, June, August, and November; five
  <i>Fridays</i> in March, June, September, and December; five
  <i>Saturdays</i> in April, July, September, and December; and, lastly,
  fifty-three <i>Sundays</i> in the year.</p>

  <p>The age of her Majesty the Queen is thirty-five, or seven times five;
  and the age of Prince Albert the same.</p>

  <p>Last Christmas having fallen on the Sunday, I am reminded of the

  <p><i>A Significant Hint.</i>&mdash;The following lines were communicated
  to me by a friend some years ago, as having been written by a blacksmith
  of the village of Tideswell in Derbyshire; who, having often been
  reproved by the parson, or ridiculed by his neighbours, for drunkenness,
  placed them on the church door the day after the event they
  commemorate:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ye Tideswellites, can this be true,</p>
      <p class="i1">Which Fame's loud trumpet brings;</p>
      <p>That ye, to view the Cambrian Prince,</p>
      <p class="i1">Forsook the King of Kings?</p>
      <p>That when his rattling chariot wheels,</p>
      <p class="i1">Proclaim'd his Highness near,</p>
      <p>Ye trod upon each others' heels,</p>
      <p class="i1">To leave the house of prayer.</p>

      <p class="i1">Lest ye be left i' th' lurch;</p>
      <p>And place at th' end of th' town a man</p>
      <p class="i1">To ask him into Church."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is said that, on the occasion of the late Prince of Wales passing
  through Tideswell on a Sunday, a man was placed to give notice of his
  coming, and the parson and his flock rushed out to see him pass at full
  gallop.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>LITERARY QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Richard Bingham</span> will feel grateful to any
  literary friend who may be able to assist him in solving some or all of
  the following difficulties.</p>

  <p>1. Where does Panormitan or Tudeschis (<i>Commentar. in Quinque Libros
  Decretalium</i>) apply the term nullatenenses to titular and utopian
  bishops? See <i>Origines EcclesiasticÃ¦</i>, 4. 6. 2.</p>

  <p>2. In which of his books does John Bale, Bishop of Ossory, speaking of
  the monks of Bangor, term them "Apostolicals?" See Ibid., 7. 2. 13.</p>

  <p>3. Where does Erasmus say that the preachers of the Roman Church
  invoked the Virgin Mary in the beginning of their discourses, much as the
  heathen poets were used to invoke their Muses? See Ibid., 14. 4. 15.; and
  <i>Ferrarius de Ritu Concionum</i>, l. <span class="scac">I.</span> c.
  xi.</p>

  <p>4. Bona (<i>Rer. Liturg.</i>, l. <span class="scac">II.</span> c. ii.
  n. 1.) speaks of an epistle from Athanasius to Eustathius, where he
  inveighs against the Arian bishops, who in the beginning of their sermons
  said "<i>Pax vobiscum!</i>" while they harassed others, and were
  tragically at war. But the learned Bingham (14. 4. 14.) passes this by,
  and leaves it with Bona, because there is no such epistle in the works of
  Athanasius. Where else? How can Bona's error be corrected? or is there
  extant <i>in operibus Athanasii</i> a letter of his to some other person,
  containing the expressions to which Bona refers?</p>

  <p>5. In another place (<i>Rer. Liturg.</i>, l. <span
  class="scac">II.</span> c. 4. n. 3.) Bona refers to tom. iii. p. 307. of
  an <i>Auctor Antiquitatum Liturgicarum</i> for certain <i>formulÃ¦</i>;
  and Joseph Bingham (15. 1. 2.) understands him to mean <i>Pamelius</i>,
  whose work does not exceed two volumes. Neither does Pamelius notice at
  all the <i>first of the two formulÃ¦</i>, though he has the second, or
  nearly the same. How can this also be explained? And to what work, either
  anonymous or otherwise, did Bona refer in his expression "Auctor
  Antiquitatum Liturgicarum?"</p>

  <p>6. In which old edition of <i>Gratiani Decretum</i>, probably before
  the early part of the sixteenth century, can be found the unmutilated
  glosses of John Semeca, surnamed Teutonicus? and especially the gloss on
  <i>De Consecrat., Distinct.</i> 4. c. 4., where he says that even in his
  time (1250?) the custom still prevailed in some places of giving the
  eucharist to babes? See <i>Orig. Ecclesiast.</i>, 15. 4. 7.</p>

  <p>7. Joseph Bingham (16. 3. 6.) finds fault with Baronius for asserting
  that Pope Symmachus anathematized the Emperor Anastasius, and asserts
  that instead of <i>Ista quidem ego</i>, as given by Baronius and Binius,
  in the epistle of Symmachus, Ep. vii. al. vi. (see also Labbe and
  Cossart, t. iv. p. 1298.), the true reading is <i>Ista quidem nego</i>.
  How can this be verified? The epistle is not extant either in Crabbe or
  Merlin. Is the argument <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page198"></a>{198}</span>of J.&nbsp;B. borne out by any good authority,
  either in manuscript or print?</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Bingham</span> will feel further obliged if the
  Replies to any or all of these Queries be forwarded direct to his address
  at 57. Gloucester Place, Portman Square, London.</p>

  <p><i>Inman or Ingman Family.</i>&mdash;The family of Inman, Ionman, or
  Ingman, variously spelt, derive from John of Gaunt. This family was
  settled for five successive generations at Bowthwaite Grange, Netherdale
  or Nithisdale, co. York, and inter-married with many of the principal
  families of that period.</p>

  <p>Alfred Inman married Amelia, daughter of Owen Gam. Who was Owen
  Gam?</p>

  <p>Arthur Inman married Cecilia, daughter of Llewellyn Clifford. Who was
  Llewellyn Clifford? Not mentioned in the Clifford Peerage. Perhaps <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hughes</span>, or some other correspondent of "N. &amp;
  Q.," may know, and have the kindness to make known his genealogical
  history.</p>

  <p>This family being strong adherents of the House of Lancaster, raised a
  troop in the royal cause under the Duke of Newcastle, at the fatal battle
  of Marston Moor, where several brothers were slain, the rest dispersed,
  and the property confiscated to Cromwell's party about 1650-52. Any
  genealogical detail from public records prior to that period, would be
  useful in tracing the descent.</p>

  <p>Sir William de Roas de Ingmanthorpe was summoned to parliament in the
  reign of Edw. I. This Ingmanthorpe, or Inmanthorpe (spelt both ways), is,
  according to Thoresby, near Knaresborough on the Nidd. Query, Was this
  person's name Inman from his residence, as usual at that period?</p>

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p><i>Pepys.</i>&mdash;I have lately acquired a collection of letters
  between Pepys and Major Aungier, Sir Isaac Newton, Halley, and other
  persons, relating to the management of the mathematical school at
  Christ's Hospital; and containing details of the career of some of the
  King's scholars after leaving the school. The letters extend from 1692 to
  1695; and are the original letters received by Pepys, with his drafts of
  the answers. They are loosely stitched, in order of date, in a thick
  volume, and are two hundred and upwards in number. Are these letters
  known, and have they ever been published or referred to?</p>

  <p>[It is a singular coincidence that we should receive the communication

  gratified with a sight of it? We will guarantee its safe return, and any
  expenses incurred in its transmission. On turning to the fourth volume of
  the new edition of the <i>Diary</i>, we find the following letter (now
  first published) from Dr. Tanner, afterwards Bishop of St. Asaph, to Dr.
  Charlett, dated April 28, 1699:&mdash;"Mr. Pepys was just finishing a
  letter to you last night when I gave him yours. I hear he has printed
  some letters lately about the abuses of Christ's Hospital; they are only
  privately handed about. A gentleman that has a very great respect for Mr.
  Pepys, saw one of them in one of the Aldermen's hands, but wishes there
  had been some angry expressions left out; which he fears the Papists and
  other enemies of the Church of England will make ill use of." Is anything
  known of this "privately printed" volume? In the Life of Pepys (4th

  <p>"<i>Retainers to Seven Shares and a Half.</i>"&mdash;Can any reader of
  "N. &amp; Q.," conversant with the literature of the seventeenth century,
  furnish an explanation of this phrase? It occurs in the preface to
  <i>Steps to the Temple, &amp;c.</i>, of Richard Crashaw (the 2nd edit.,
  in the Savoy, 1670), addressed by "the author's friend" to "the learned
  reader," and is used in disparagement of pretenders to poetry. The
  passage runs thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It were prophane but to mention here in the preface those
  under-headed poets, retainers to seven shares and a half; madrigal
  fellows, whose only business in verse is to rime a poor sixpenny soul, a
  subburb sinner into hell," &amp;c.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The performers at our earlier theatres were distinguished into whole
  shares, three-quarter sharers, half sharers, seven-and-a-half sharers,
  hired men, &amp;c. In one scene of the <i>Histriomastic</i>, 1610, the
  dissolute performers having been arrested by soldiers, one of the latter
  exclaims, "Come on, players! now we are the sharers, and you the hired
  men;" and in another scene, Clout, one of the characters, rejects with
  some indignation the offer of "half a share." Gamaliel Ratsey, in that
  rare tract, <i>Ratseis Ghost</i>, 1606, knights the principal performer
  of a company by the title of "Sir Three Shares and a Half;" and Tucca, in
  Ben Jonson's <i>Poetaster</i>, addressing Histrio, observes, "Commend me
  to Seven shares and a half," as if some individual at that period had
  engrossed as large a proportion. Shakspeare, in <i>Hamlet</i>, speaks of
  "a whole share" as a source of no contemptible emolument, and of the
  owner of it as a person filling no inferior station in "a cry of payers."
  In <i>Northward Ho!</i> also, a sharer is noticed with respect. Bellamont
  the poet enters, and tells his servant, "Sirrah, I'll speak with none:"
  on which the servant asks, "Not a player?" and his master replies:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6hg3">"No, though a sharer bawl:</p>
      <p>I'll speak with none, although it be the mouth</p>
      <p>Of the big company."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The value of a share in any particular company would depend upon the
  number of subdivisions, upon the popularity of the body, upon the
  stock-plays belonging to it, upon the extent of its wardrobe, and the
  nature of its properties.&mdash;See Collier's <i>English Dramatic
  Poetry</i>, vol. iii. p. 427.]</p>

  <p><i>Madden's "Reflections and Resolutions proper for the Gentlemen of
  Ireland."</i>&mdash;This work, by the Rev. Samuel Madden, was first
  published in Dublin in 1738, and was reprinted at the expense of the late
  Mr. Thomas Pleasants, in one vol. 8vo., pp. 224, Dub. 1816. I possess two
  copies of the original edition, likewise in one vol. 8vo., pp. 237, and I
  have seen about a dozen; and yet I find in the preface to the reprint the
  following paragraph:</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>"The very curious and interesting work which is now reprinted, and
  intended for a wide and gratuitous circulation, is also of uncommon
  rarity; there is not a copy of it in the library of Trinity College, or
  in any of the other public libraries of this city, which have been
  searched on purpose. (One was purchased some <!-- Page 200 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>{200}</span>years ago for the
  library of the Royal Dublin Society, if I mistake not, for 1<i>l.</i>
  6<i>s.</i>, or rather more.) The profoundly learned Vice-Provost, Doctor
  Barrett, never met with one; and many gentlemen well skilled in the
  literature of Ireland, who have been applied to for information on the
  subject, are even unacquainted with the name of the book."</p>

</div>

  <p>Of Dr. Madden, known as "Premium" Madden, few memorials exist; and yet
  he was a man of whom Johnson said, "His was a name Ireland ought to
  honour." The book in question does not appear to be of "uncommon rarity."
  Is it considered by competent judges of "exceeding merit?" I would be
  glad to know.</p>

<h3>RAPPING NO NOVELTY; AND TABLE-TURNING.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 512. 632.; Vol. ix., pp. 39. 88. 135.)</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is a curious criminal process on record, manuscript 1770,
  noticed by Voltaire as in the library of the King of France, which was
  founded upon a remarkable set of visions said to have occurred to the
  monks of Orleans.</p>

  <p>"The illustrious house of St. Memin had been very liberal to the
  convent, and had their family vault under the church. The wife of a Lord
  of St. Memin, Provost of Orleans, died, and was buried. The husband,
  thinking that his ancestors had given more than enough to the convent,
  sent the monks a present, which they thought too small. They formed a
  plan to have her body disinterred, and to force the widower to pay a
  second fee for depositing it again in holy ground.</p>

  <p>"The soul of the lady first appeared to two of the brethren, and said
  to them, 'I am damned, like Judas, because my husband has not given
  sufficient.' They hoped to extort money for the repose of her soul. But
  the husband said, 'If she is really damned, all the money in the world
  won't save her,' and gave them nothing. Perceiving their mistake, they
  declared she appeared again, saying she was in <i>Purgatory</i>, and <!--
  Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page201"></a>{201}</span>demanding to be disinterred. But this
  seemed a curious request, and excited suspicion, for it was not likely
  that a soul in purgatory would ask to have the body removed from holy
  ground, neither had any in purgatory ever been known to desire to be
  exhumed.</p>

  <p>"The soul after this did not try <i>speaking</i> any more, but haunted
  everybody in the convent and church. Brother Peter of Arras adopted a
  very awkward manner of conjuring it. He said to it, 'If thou art the soul
  of the late Madame de St. Memin, strike four knocks,' and the four knocks
  were struck. 'If thou art damned, strike six knocks,' and the six knocks
  were struck. 'If thou art still tormented in hell, because thy body is
  buried in holy ground, knock six more times,' and the six knocks were
  heard still more distinctly. 'If we disinter thy body, wilt thou be less
  damned, certify to us by five knocks,' and the soul so certified. This
  statement was signed by twenty-two cordeliers. The father provincial
  asked the same questions and received the same answers. The Lord of St.
  Memin prosecuted the father cordeliers. Judges were appointed. The
  general of the commission required that they should be burned; but the
  sentence only condemned them to make the 'amende honorable,' with a torch
  in their bosom, and to be banished."</p>

  have practised this imposition, and to have been banished for their

<h3>GENERAL WHITELOCKE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 521. 621.)</p>

  <p>Much interesting information concerning General Whitelocke, about
  whose conduct some difference of opinion appears to exist, will be found
  in the Rev. Erskine Neale's <i>Risen from the Ranks</i> (London,
  Longmans, 1853); but neither the date nor the place of his death is there
  given. The reverend writer's account of the general's conduct is not at
  all favourable. After alluding to him as "a chief unequal to his
  position," he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"John Whitelocke was born in the year 1759, and received his early
  education in the Grammar School at Marlborough. His father was steward to
  John, fourth Earl of Aylesbury; and the peer, in <!-- Page 202 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>{202}</span>acknowledgment of the
  faithful services of his trusted dependent, placed young Whitelocke at
  Lochee's Military Academy, near Chelsea. There he remained till 1777,
  when, the Earl's friendly disposition remaining in full force, and the
  youth's predilection for a military career continuing unabated, an
  ensigncy was procured him, through Lord Aylesbury's intervention, in the
  14th regiment of Foot."&mdash;<i>Risen from the Ranks</i>, p. 68.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Through the influence of his brother-in-law, General Brownrigge,
  Whitelocke's promotion was rapid; and in 1807 he was gazetted
  commander-in-chief of an expedition destined for the recapture of Buenos
  Ayres. His conduct during this expedition became the subject of a
  court-martial; he was found guilty, sentenced to be cashiered, and
  declared to be "totally unfit to serve his Majesty in any military
  capacity whatever."</p>

  <p>Judging from the evidence adduced, the conduct of the
  commander-in-chief was totally unworthy of the flag under which he
  served, and highly calculated to arouse the indignation of the men whom
  he commanded; and for some considerable time, whenever the soldiers met
  together to take a friendly glass, the toast was, "Success to <i>grey
  hairs</i>, but bad luck to <i>White-locks</i>!" On the whole, the Rev. E.
  Neale's account seems to be quite impartial; and most persons, after
  reading the evidence of the general's extremely vacillating conduct, will
  be inclined to agree with him in awarding this unfortunate officer the
  title of the "Flincher-General at Buenos Ayres."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">James Spence Harry.</span></p>

  <p>I have only just seen your correspondent's Reply (Vol. ix., p. 87.)
  respecting General Whitelocke. He is right in stating that the general
  resided at Clifton: he might have added, as late as 1830; but he had
  previously, for time, lived at Butcombe Court, Somersetshire.</p>

  <p>There is an anecdote still rife in the neighbourhood, that when
  Whitelocke came down to see the house before taking it, he put up at an
  inn, and after dinner asked the landlord to take a glass of wine with
  him. Upon announcing, however, who he was, the landlord started up and
  declared he would not drink another glass with him, throwing down at the
  same time the price of the bottle, that he might not be indebted to the
  general.</p>

  <p>Respecting the story of the flints, it is said that he desired them to
  be taken out of the muskets, wishing that the men should only use their
  bayonets against the enemy.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Ardelio.</span></p>

  <p>I remember well that soon after the unsuccessful attack of General
  Whitelocke upon Buenos Ayres, it was stated that the flints had been
  taken out of the muskets of some of our regiments because they were quite
  raw troops, and the General thought that they might, from want of
  knowledge and use of fire-arms, do more mischief to themselves than to
  the enemy, and that they had better trust to the bayonet alone. The
  consequence was, that when they entered the streets of the town, they
  found no enemy in them to whom they could apply the bayonet. The
  inhabitants and troops were in the strong stone houses, and fired on and
  killed our men with perfect impunity, as not a shot could be fired in
  return: to surrender was their only chance of life. A reference to a file
  of newspapers of that date (which I am too lazy to make myself) will show
  whether this was understood at the time to be a fact or not.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Ss.</span></p>

  <p>In the <i>Autobiography of B. Haydon</i> (I think vol. i.), he
  mentions that as he was passing through Somersetshire on his way from
  Plymouth to London, he saw General Whitelocke. A reference to the passage
  may interest G.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;S.</p>

<h3>"MAN PROPOSES, BUT GOD DISPOSES."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 552.; Vol. ix., p. 87.)</p>

  <p>1. If your correspondent H. P. will again examine my communication on
  this subject, he will find that I have <i>not</i> overlooked the view
  which attributes the <i>De Imitatione</i> to John Gerson, but have
  expressly referred to it.</p>

  <p>2. If Gerson <i>was</i> the author, this will not prove that in
  quoting the proverb in question, Piers Ploughman quoted from the <i>De
  Imitatione</i>, as H.&nbsp;P. supposes. The dates which I gave will show this.
  The <i>Vision</i> was written about <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1362,
  whereas, according to Du Pin, John Gerson was born December 14, 1363,
  took a prominent part in the Council of Constance, 1414, and died in
  1429. Of the Latin writers of the fifteenth century, Mosheim says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At their head we may justly place John Gerson, Chancellor of the
  University of Paris, the most illustrious ornament that this age can
  boast of, a man of great influence and authority, whom the Council of
  Constance looked upon an its oracle, the lovers of liberty as their
  patron, and whose memory is yet precious to such among the French clergy
  as are at all zealous for the maintenance of their privileges against
  papal despotism."&mdash;<i>Ecc. Hist.</i>, cent. xv. ch. ii. sec. 24.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>3. Gerson was not a Benedictine monk, but a Parisian curÃ©, and Canon
  of Notre Dame:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He was made curate (<i>curÃ©</i>, parson or rector) of St. John's, in
  Greve, on the 29th of March, 1408, and <!-- Page 203 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>{203}</span>continued so to 1413,
  when in a sedition raised by the partizans of the Duke of Burgundy, his
  house was plundered by the mob, and he obliged to fly into the church of
  Notre Dame, where he continued for some time concealed."&mdash;Du Pin,
  <i>History of the Church</i>, cent. xv. ch. viii.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is said that the treatise in question first appeared&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Appended to a MS. of Gerson's <i>De Consolatione TheologiÃ¦</i>, dated
  1421. This gave rise to the supposition that he was the real author of
  that celebrated work; and indeed it is a very doubtful point whether this
  opinion is true or not, there being several high authorities which
  ascribe to him the authorship of that book."&mdash;Knight's <i>Penny
  CyclopÃ¦dia</i>, vol. vi. art. "Gerson."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Was there then <i>another</i> John Gerson, a monk, and Abbot of St.
  Stephen, between 1200 and 1240, to whom, as well as to the above, the
  <i>De Imitatione</i> has been ascribed? This, though not impossible,
  appears extremely improbable. Is H.&nbsp;P. prepared with evidence to prove
  it?</p>

  <p>Du Pin, in the chapter above quoted, farther says, in speaking of the
  <i>De Imitatione Christi</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The style is pretty much like that of the other devotional books of
  Thomas Ã  Kempis. Nevertheless, in his lifetime it was attributed to St.
  Bernard and Gerson. The latter was most commonly esteemed the author of
  it in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Afterwards some MSS. of it
  were found in Italy, where it is attributed to one Gerson or Gessen, to
  whom is given the title of <i>abbot</i>. Perhaps Gersen or Gessen are
  only corruptions of the name of Gerson. Notwithstanding, there are two
  things which will hardly let us believe that this was Gerson's book; one,
  that the author calls himself a monk, the other, that the style is very
  different from that of the Chancellor of Paris. All this makes it
  difficult to decide to which of these three authors it belongs. We must
  leave Thomas Ã  Kempis in possession of what is attributed to him, without
  deciding positively in his favour."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lower says in his Preface, p. x.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Of the identity of the author nothing certain can be inferred, beyond

<h3>NAPOLEON'S SPELLING.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 386. 502.)</p>

  <p>The question as to Napoleon's spelling may seem, at first sight, to be
  one of little importance; and yet, if we will look at it aright, we shall
  find that it involves many points of interest for the philosopher and the
  historian. During a residence of some years in France, I had heard it
  remarked, more than once, by persons who appeared hostile to the Napoleon
  dynasty, that its great founder had, in his bulletins and other public
  documents, shown an unaccountable ignorance of the common rules of
  orthography: but I had never seen the assertion put forth by any
  competent writer until I met with the remarks of Macaulay, already quoted
  by me, Vol. viii., p. 386.</p>

  <p>In reply to my inquiry as to the authority for this statement, your
  correspondent C. has readily and kindly furnished a passable from
  Bourrienne's <i>MÃ©moires</i>, in which it is alleged that Napoleon's
  "orthographe est en gÃ©nÃ©ral <i>extraordinairement estropiÃ©e</i>."</p>

  <p>From all this it must be taken for granted, as, indeed, it has never
  been denied, that Napoleon's spelling is defective; but the question to
  be considered is, whether that defectiveness was the effect of ignorance
  or of design. That it did not arise from ignorance would seem probable
  for the following reasons.</p>

  <p>Napoleon received his education chiefly in France; and it is to be
  presumed that the degree of instruction in grammar, orthography, &amp;c.,
  <i>ordinarily</i> bestowed on educated Frenchmen, was not withheld from
  him.</p>

  <p>To say the least of it, he was endued with sufficient intelligence to
  acquire an <i>ordinary</i> knowledge of such matters.</p>

  <p>Nay more: he was a man of the highest order of genius. Between the
  possession of genius, and a knowledge of orthography, there is, I admit,
  no necessary connexion. The humblest pedagogue may be able to spell more
  correctly than the greatest philosopher. But neither, on the other hand,
  does genius of any kind necessarily preclude a knowledge of spelling.</p>

  <p>While still a young man, Napoleon wrote several works in French, such
  as the <i>Souper de Beaucaire</i>, the <i>MÃ©moire sur la Culture du
  MÃ»rier</i>, &amp;c. Some of the manuscripts of these writings must be
  still extant; and a comparison of the spelling of his unpretending youth,
  with that of his aspiring <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page204"></a>{204}</span>manhood, would show at once whether the
  "<i>orthographe extraordinairement estropiÃ©e</i>" of his later
  productions was the result of habit or design.</p>

  <p>The orthography of the French language is peculiarly intricate; and it
  is no uncommon thing to meet with educated men in that country who are
  unable to spell with accuracy. That Napoleon may have been in a similar
  predicament, would not be surprising; but that it should be said of the
  most <i>extraordinary</i> man of the age, that his spelling is
  <i>extraordinairement estropiÃ©e</i>, seems inexplicable upon any fair
  supposition, except that he accounted the rules of spelling unworthy the
  attention of any but copyists and office drudges; or (which is more
  probable) that he wished this extraordinary spelling to be received as an
  indication of the great rapidity with which he could commit his thoughts
  to paper.</p>

<h3>MEMOIRS OF GRAMMONT.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 461. 549.; Vol. ix., p. 3.)</p>

  <p>There appearing to be a strong feeling that a correct edition of these
  <i>Memoirs</i> should be published, with the present inaccurate notes
  thoroughly revised, I send you a few notes from a collection I have made
  on the subject.</p>

  <p>The proper orthography of the name is "Gramont," and the family
  probably originally came from Spain. Matta's friend, the Marquis de
  Sevantes, asserts the fact; and it is corroborated by the fact, that on
  the occasion of the Marshal de Grammont's demanding the hand of the
  Infanta Maria Theresa for Louis XIV., the people cried, "Viva el Marescal
  de Agramont, que es de nuestro sangue!" And the King of Spain said to the
  Marshal after the presentation of his sons, the Counts de Guiche and De
  Louvigny, "Teneis Muy Buenos y lindos hijos y bien se hecha de ver que
  los Agramonteses salen de la sangue de Espana."</p>

  <p>The Grammont family had been so enriched and ennobled by its repeated
  marriages with the heiresses of great families, that, like many noble
  houses of our own times, members of it hardly knew their own correct
  surname: thus, in the famous declaration of the parliament of Paris
  against the Peers in 1717, on the subject of the Caps, it was said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Grammonts have determined on their armorial bearings, and hold to
  those of the house of Aure. The Count de Grammont said one day to the
  Marshal, What arms shall we use this year?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Grammonts in the male line are descended from Sancho Garcia
  d'Aure, Viscount de l'Arboust. Menaud d'Aure, his lineal representative,
  married Claire de Grammont, sister and heiress of Jean, Seigneur de
  Grammont, and daughter of Francis, Seigneur de Grammont, and Catherine
  d'Andoins his wife.</p>

  <p>Menaud d'Aure is the ancestor who is disguised in the <i>Memoirs</i>
  as "Menaudaure" and "Menodore;" and in the notes, coupled with "la belle
  Corisande," they are styled two of the ancestresses of the family
  celebrated for their beauty.</p>

  <p>Philibert, who was styled Philibert de Grammont and de Toulongeon,
  Count de Grammont and de Guiche, Viscount d'Aster, Captain of fifty men
  at arms, Governor and Mayor of Bayonne, Seneschal of Bearne, married on
  Aug. 7, 1567, Diana, better known as "La belle Corisande" d'Andouins,
  Viscountess de Louvigny, Dame de Lescun, the only daughter of Paul
  Viscount de Louvigny; who, although a Huguenot, was killed at the siege
  of Rouen, fighting under the command of the Duke de Guise. They had two
  children: Antoine, subsequently the first duke, and Catherine, who
  married Francois Nompar de Chaumont, Count de Lauzun, the ancestor of the
  celebrated Duke de Lauzun, who was first introduced at court by his
  relative the Marshal de Grammont.</p>

  <p>This Philibert, Count de Grammont, was killed at the siege of La Fere
  in Aug. 1580. The connexion between his widow, the fair Corisande, and
  Henry IV., was subsequent to the Count's death.</p>

  <p>The Duchy Peerage was created on Dec. 13, 1643. Antoine, the first
  duke, married, firstly, on Sept. 1, 1601, Louise, eldest daughter of the
  Marshal de Roquelaure; she died in 1610, leaving Antoine, subsequently
  the Marshal Duke de Grammont, and Roger, Count de Louvigny, killed in a
  duel in Flanders on March 18, 1629. The Duke de Grammont married,
  secondly, on March 29, 1618, Claude, eldest daughter of Louis de
  Montmorency, Baron de Boutteville; and had Henri, Count de Toulongeon,
  who died unmarried on Sept. 1, 1679; Philibert, the celebrated Chevalier
  de Grammont, who was born in 1621; and three daughters.</p>

  <p>The Marshal de Grammont was one of the most celebrated men of the
  court of Louis XIV.: he was a favourite both of Richelieu and Mazarin,
  and married a niece of the former; and, as a wit, was not inferior to his
  brother the Chevalier. He sided with the Court during the wars of the
  Fronde; whilst the Chevalier in the first instance joined the Prince of
  CondÃ©, probably from their mutual connexion with the Montmorency family.
  The Marshal died at Bayonne, on July 12, 1678, aged seventy-four years,
  leaving four children, of whom the Count de Guiche and the Princess de
  Monaco are well known.</p>

  <p>The Chevalier de Grammont received his outfit from his mother, and
  joined the army under Prince Thomas of Savoy, then besieging Trin in
  Piedmont, which was taken on Sept. 24, 1643. The notes to the
  <i>Memoirs</i> say May 4, 1639; but that <!-- Page 205 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>{205}</span>was a former siege by
  the French, then under the command of the Cardinal de la Vallette.</p>

  <p>Probably this will be as much as you can afford space for at present,
  and I will therefore reserve any farther communications for a future
  Number.</p>

<h3>THE MYRTLE BEE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 593.)</p>

  <p>Ere venturing an opinion as to the exact size of the above, as
  compared with the Golden-crested Wren, I should much like to ascertain
  where I am likely to meet with a faithful specimen of the latter? The
  Myrtle Bee is about half the size of the common Wren, certainly not
  larger: and I always took it for granted, the bird derived its name from
  its diminutiveness and the cover it frequented. I cannot say the bird was
  generally known in the neighbourhood, having only met with it when in
  company with sportsmen, in a description of country little frequented by
  others. I originally obtained the name when a boy from a deceased parent
  whom I accompanied out shooting; and for a succession of years the bird
  was familiar to me, in fact, to all sportsmen of that period who shot
  over the immediate locality; we all knew it, although its name was seldom
  mentioned. In fact, it never induced a thought beyond&mdash;"Confound the
  bees, how they bother the dogs"&mdash;or some such expression. I am
  unacquainted with the Dartford Warbler (<i>Sylvia provincialis</i>,
  Gmel.); but the description as quoted by Mr. Salmon from Yarrell's
  <i>Hist. of British Birds</i>, 1839, vol. i. p. 311. et seq., differs
  from the Myrtle Bee. The Warbler is said to haunt and build among furze
  on commons, and flies with jerks; whereas I never met with the Myrtle Bee
  among furze, neither does it fly with jerks: on the contrary, its short
  flight is rapid, steady, and direct. The description of the Warbler
  appears to agree with a small bird well known here as the Furze Chat, but
  which is out of all proportion as compared with the Myrtle Bee.</p>

  <p>As regards the Query touching the possibility of my memory being
  treacherous respecting the colour of the bird, after a lapse of
  twenty-five years, more faith will be placed therein on my stating that I
  am an old fly-fisher, making my own flies: and that no strange bird ever
  came to hand without undergoing a searching scrutiny as to colour and
  texture of the feathers, with the view of converting it to fishing
  purposes. No such use could be made of the Bee. In a former Number I
  described the tongue of the Myrtle Bee as round, sharp, and pointed at
  the end, appearing capable of penetration. I beg to say that I was solely
  indebted to accident in being able to do so, viz. the tongue protruded
  beyond the point of the bill, owing to the pressure it received in my
  dog's mouth; the dog having brought it out enveloped in dead grass, from
  the foot of the myrtle bush.</p>

<h3>CELTIC ETYMOLOGY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 136.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span> seems to confine the word
  <i>Celtic</i> to the Irish branch of that dialect. My notion of the words
  <i>iosal</i> and <i>iriosal</i> is taken from the Highland Gaelic, and
  the authorised version of the Bible in that language. Let Celtic scholars
  who look to the sense of words in the <i>four</i> spoken languages,
  decide between us. There can be no doubt of the meaning of the two words
  in the Gaelic of Job v. 11. and Ps. iv. 6. In Welsh, and (I believe) in
  bas-Breton, there is no word similar to <i>uim</i> or <i>umhal</i>, in
  the senses of <i>humus</i> and <i>humilis</i>, to be found. In Gaelic
  <i>uir</i> is more common than <i>uim</i>, and <i>talamh</i> more common
  than either in the sense of <i>humus</i>; and in that of <i>humble</i>,
  <i>iosal</i> and <i>iriosal</i> are much more common than
  <i>umhal</i>.</p>

  <p>It is certain that Latin was introduced into Ireland before it reached
  the Highlands, and Christianity with it; and therefore, as this word is
  not found in one branch of the Celtic at all, and is not a very common
  word in another, it is not unreasonable to suppose that it is of Latin
  origin. The sense which <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span> declares to
  be the only sense of <i>iosal</i> and <i>iriosal</i>, is precisely that
  which is the nearest to the original meaning of <i>low</i>, and <i>low as
  the earth</i>; and this is also the sense which <i>humilis</i> always
  bears in classical Latin, though Christianity (which first recognised
  <i>humility</i> as a virtue, instead of stigmatising it as a meanness)
  attached to it the sense which its derivatives in all modern Romance
  languages, with the exception of Italian, exclusively bear.</p>

  <p>Now <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span> has omitted to notice the
  fact that <i>umhal</i> in Gaelic, and, I believe, <i>umal</i> in Irish,
  have not the intermediate sense of <i>low</i> and <i>cringing</i>, but
  only the Christian sense of <i>humble</i>, as a virtuous attribute. It
  seems natural that if <i>uim</i> and <i>umal</i> were radical words, the
  latter would bear the some relation to <i>uim</i>, in every respect,
  which <i>humilis</i> does to <i>humus</i>, its supposed derivative. But
  unless <i>humus</i> be derived from <span title="chamai" class="grk"
  >&chi;&#x1F71;&mu;&alpha;&iota;</span> (the root of <span title="chthÃ´n" class="grk"
  >&chi;&theta;&#x1F7C;&nu;</span> and <span title="chthamalos" class="grk"
  >&chi;&theta;&alpha;&mu;&alpha;&lambda;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;</span>), how does
  <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span> account for the <i>h</i>, which had
  a sound in Latin as well as <i>horror</i> and <i>hostilis</i>, both of
  which retain the aspirate in English, though they lose it in French? If
  <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span> will tell me why <i>horreur</i> and
  <i>hostile</i> have no aspirate in French, I will tell him why
  <i>heir</i>, <i>honour</i>, and <i>humour</i> have none in English,
  though <i>humid</i> (which is as closely connected with <i>humour</i>, as
  <i>humidus</i> is with <i>humor</i>) retains the aspirate. <!-- Page 206
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>{206}</span></p>

  <p>These Celtic etymologies, however, though amusing, do not touch the
  main point, which is simply this: the usual mode of pronouncing the word
  <i>humble</i> in good English society. What that is, seems to be so
  satisfactorily shown by your correspondent S.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;C., Vol. viii., p. 393.,
  that all farther argument on the subject would be superfluous.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Improvements in the Albumenized Process.</i>&mdash;Your expectation
  of being soon able to announce the successful manufacture of a new
  negative calotype paper, will, I am sure, be gladly received by many
  photographers, and especially by those who, like me, have been subjected
  to much disappointment with Turner's paper. For one sheet that has turned
  out well, at least half-a-dozen have proved useless from spottiness, and
  some sheets do not take the iodizing solution evenly, from an apparent
  want of uniformity in the texture of the paper, which causes the solution
  to penetrate portions the moment it is laid on the solution. Undoubtedly,
  when it does succeed, it is superior to Whatman's, but this is not enough
  to compensate for its extreme uncertainty.</p>

  <p>In <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond's</span> directions for the calotype,
  he gave a formula for the addition of bromide of potassium to the iodide
  of potassium, but did not speak with much certainty as to the
  proportions. Will he kindly say whether he has made farther trials; and
  if so, whether they confirm the proportions given by him, or have led him
  to adopt any change in this respect? and will he likewise say whether the
  iodizing solution which he recommends for Turner's paper, is suitable
  also to Whatman's?</p>

  <p>In albumenizing paper, I have not found it desirable to remove the
  paper very slowly from the solution. Whenever I have done so, it has
  invariably dried with waves and streaks, which quite spoiled the sheet. A
  steady motion, neither too slow nor too quick, I have found succeed
  perfectly, so that I now never spoil a sheet. I have used the solution
  with less albumen than recommended by <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond</span>. My formula has been.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Albumen              8 oz.</p>
      <p>Water                12 oz.</p>
      <p>Muriate ammon.       60 grs.</p>
      <p>Common salt          60 grs.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And this, I find, gives a sufficient gloss to the paper; but that of
  course is a matter of taste.</p>

  <p>I have not either found it essential to allow the paper to remain on
  the solution three minutes or longer, as recommended by <span
  class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>. With Canson paper, either negative or
  positive, a minute and a half has been sufficient. I have used two
  dishes, and as soon as a sheet was removed, drained, and replaced, I have
  taken the sheet from the other dish. In this way I found that each sheet
  lay on the solution about one and a half minutes, and with the assistance
  of a person to hang and dry them (which I have done before a fire), I
  have prepared from forty to forty-five sheets in an hour, requiring of
  course to be ironed afterwards.</p>

  <p>I have tried a solution of nitrate of silver of thirty grains to one
  ounce of distilled water, to excite this paper, and it appears to answer
  just as well as forty grains. I send you two small collodion views, takes
  by me and printed on albumenized paper prepared as mentioned, and excited
  with a 30-grain solution of nitrate of silver.</p>

  <p>Is there any certain way of telling the right side of Canson paper,
  negative and positive? On the positive paper on one side, when held in a
  particular position towards the light, shaded bars may be observed; and
  on this side, when looked <i>through</i>, the name reads right. Is this
  the right or the wrong side?</p>

  <p class="author">C. E. F.</p>

  <p>Since I wrote to you last, I have tried a solution of twelve grains
  only of nitrate of silver to the ounce of distilled water, for the paper
  albumenized, as mentioned in my letter of the 13th of February, and have
  found it to answer perfectly. The paper I used was <i>thin</i> Canson,
  floated for one minute exactly on the solution; but I have no doubt the
  thick Canson will succeed just as well; and here I may observe that I
  have never found any advantage in allowing the paper to rest on the
  solution for three or four minutes, as generally recommended, but the
  contrary, as the paper, without being in the least more sensitive,
  becomes much sooner discoloured by keeping. My practice has been to float
  the thin Canson about half a minute, and the thick Canson not more than a
  minute.</p>

  <p class="author">C. E. F.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Crookes on restoring old Collodion.</i>&mdash;I am happy to
  explain to your correspondent what I consider to be the <i>rationale</i>
  of the process.</p>

  <p>The colour which iodized collodion assumes on keeping, I consider to
  be entirely due to the gradual separation of iodine from the iodide of
  potassium or ammonium originally introduced. There are several ways in
  which this may take place; if the cotton on paper contain the slightest
  trace of nitric acid, owing to its not being <i>thoroughly</i> washed
  (and this is not as easy as is generally supposed), the liberation of
  iodine in the collodion is certain to take place a short time after its
  being made.</p>

  <p>It is possible also that there may be a gradual decomposition of the
  zyloidin itself, and consequent liberation of the iodide by this means,
  with formation of nitrate of potassa or ammonia; but the most probable
  cause I consider to be the following. The ether gradually absorbs oxygen
  from the atmosphere, being converted into acetic acid; this, by its
  superior affinities, reacts on the iodide present, converting it into
  acetate, with liberation of hydriodic acid; while this latter, under the
  influence of the atmospheric oxygen, is very rapidly converted into water
  and iodine.</p>

  <p>I am satisfied by experiment that this is one of the causes of the
  separation of iodine, and I think it is the only one, for the following
  reason; neither bromised nor chlorised collodion undergo the slightest
  change of colour, however long they may be kept. Now, if the former
  agencies were at work, there is no reason why bromine should not be
  liberated from a bromide as well as iodine from an iodide; but on the
  latter <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page207"></a>{207}</span>supposition, could take place, the
  affinities of acetic acid being insufficient to displace hydrobromic
  acid.</p>

  <p>A great many experiments which I tried last autumn, for the express
  purpose of clearing up this point, have convinced me that, <i>cÃ¦teris
  paribus</i>, the addition of free iodine to the iodizing solution, tends
  to diminish the sensitiveness of the subsequently formed iodide of
  silver. On paper, this diminution of sensitiveness is attended with some
  advantages, so that at present I hardly know whether to introduce the
  free iodine or not; but in collodion, as far as my experience goes, I see
  no reason for retaining it; on the contrary, everything seems to be in
  favour of its removal.</p>

  <p>I can hardly imagine that the increased sensitiveness mentioned by
  <span class="sc">Mr. Hennah</span> is really due to the free iodine which
  he introduces. Such a result being so contrary to all my experience, I
  would venture to suggest that there must be some other cause for its
  beneficial action; for instance, commercial iodide of potassium is
  generally alkaline, owing to impurities present; the tincture of iodine
  in this case would render the collodion neutral, and unless a very large
  excess of iodine were introduced, its good effects would be very
  apparent. This, however, involving the employment of impure chemicals, is
  a very improbable explanation of a phenomenon observed by so excellent an
  operator as <span class="sc">Mr. Hennah</span>: there is most likely some
  local cause which would be overlooked unless expressly searched for.</p>

  <p>With regard to the point, whether the free iodine is the <i>sole</i>
  cause of the deterioration of old collodion, I should say decidedly not,
  at least in a theoretical view; the liberation of free iodine
  necessitates some other changes in the collodion, and the result must be
  influenced by these in one way or another, but practically I have as yet
  found nothing to warrant the supposition that they perceptibly interfere
  with the sensitiveness of the film.</p>

  <p>In the above I have endeavoured as much as possible to avoid
  technicalities, in order to make it intelligible to amateurs; but if
  there be any part which may be considered obscure, on its being pointed
  out to me, I will endeavour to solve the difficulty.</p>

  so many changes, and has been so much written about, that we are at a
  loss to discover or to determine whether it has been at length settled,
  in the mind of the inventor, that it will do equally well for negatives
  as for positives.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[1. Both papers are equally available for both purposes. In actual
  practice we have not ourselves experienced any difference in their

  <p>2. It is quite immaterial. A drachm of bichloride dissolved in one
  ounce of spirits of wine will cause a cloudiness and a precipitate, if a
  very few drops are added to the tested water.</p>

  <p>3. In general the salts of iron are more adapted for positives, and
  weak pyrogallic acid solutions for negatives; say one and a half grain of
  pyrogallic acid, twenty minims of glacial acetic acid, and an ounce of
  distilled water.]</p>

  <p><i>London Fortifications</i> (Vol. ix., p. 174.).&mdash;In last week's
  Number is an inquiry as to "London Fortifications" in the time of the
  Commonwealth.</p>

  <p>There is a Map by Vertue, dated 1738, in a folio <i>History of
  London</i>; there is one a trifle smaller, copied from the above; also
  one with page of description, <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, June, 1749. I
  subscribed to a set of twenty etchings, published last year by Mr. P.
  Thompson of the New Road; they are very curious, being facsimiles of a
  set of drawings done by a Capt. John Eyre of Oliver Cromwell's own
  regiment, dated 1643. The drawings are now I believe in the possession of
  the City of London.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">A Constant Reader.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The drawings referred to by our correspondent are, we hear, by
  competent judges regarded as <i>not genuine</i>. Such also, we are told,
  is the opinion given of many drawings ascribed to Hollar and Captain John
  Eyre, which have been purchased by a gentleman of our acquaintance, and
  submitted by him to persons most conversant with such drawings. Query,
  Are the drawings purporting to be by Captain John Eyre, drawings of the
  period at which they are dated?]</p>

  <p><i>Burke's Domestic Correspondence</i> (Vol. ix., p. 9.).&mdash;In
  reference to a Query in "N.&amp; Q." relative to unpublished documents
  respecting Edmund Burke, I beg to inform your correspondent N.&nbsp;O. that I
  have no doubt but that some new light might be thrown on the subject by
  an application to Mr. George Shackleton, Ballitore, a descendant of
  Abraham Shackleton, Burke's old schoolmaster, who I believe has a
  quantity of letters written to his old master Abraham, and also to his
  son Richard, who had Burke for a schoolfellow, and continued the
  friendship afterwards, both by writing and personally. When Richard
  attended yearly meetings in London, he was always a guest at
  Beaconsfield. Burke was so much attached to Richard, that on one of these
  visits he caused Shackleton's portrait to be painted and presented it to
  him, and it is now in the possession of the above family. I have no doubt
  but that an application to the above gentleman would produce some
  testimony.</p>

  <p><i>Muffins and Crumpets</i> (Vol. ix., p. 77).&mdash;Crumpet,

  <p>The latter part of the description is very applicable to this

  to eat a hard cake (Halliwell's <i>Archaisms</i>). Perhaps its usual

  muff-like softness to the touch before toasting.</p>

  <p>"<i>Clunk</i>" (Vol. viii., p. 65.).&mdash;The Scotch, and English,
  <i>clunk</i> must have different meanings: for Jamieson defines the verb
  <i>to clunk</i> "to emit a hollow and interrupted sound, as that
  proceeding from any liquid confined in a cask, when shaken, if the cask
  be not full;" and <i>to guggle</i>, as a "straight-necked bottle, when it
  is emptying;" and yet I am inclined to believe that the word also
  signifies <i>to swallow</i>, as in England. In the humorous ballad of
  "Rise up and bar the door," <i>clunk</i> seems to be used in the sense of
  to swallow:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And first they eat the while puddins, and then they eat the black;</p>
      <p>The gudeman said within himsel, the Deil <i>clunk</i> ower ai that."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That is, may you swallow the devil with the black puddings, they
  perhaps being the best to the good man's taste. True, I have seen the
  word printed "clink," instead of <i>clunk</i> in this song; but
  erroneously I think, as there is no signification of <i>clink</i> in
  Jamieson that could be appropriately used by the man who saw his
  favourite puddings devoured before his face. To <i>clink</i>, means to
  "beat smartly", to "rivet the point of a nail," to "propagate scandal, or
  any rumour quickly;" none of which significations could be substituted
  for <i>clunk</i> in the ballad.</p>

  <p><i>Picts' Houses</i> (Vol. viii., p. 392.).&mdash;Such buildings
  underground as those described as Picts' <!-- Page 209 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>{209}</span>houses, were not
  uncommon on the borders of the Tweed. A number of them, apparently
  constructed as described, were discovered in a field on the farm of
  Whitsome Hill, Berwickshire, about forty years ago. They were supposed to
  have been made for the detention of prisoners taken in the frays during
  the Border feuds: and afterwards they were employed to conceal spirits,
  smuggled either across the Border, or from abroad.</p>

  <p><i>Tailless Cats</i> (Vol. ix., p. 10.).&mdash;The tailless cats are
  still procurable in the Isle of Man, though many an unfortunate pussey

  tailless breed are rather longer in the hind legs than the ordinary cat,
  and grow to a large size.</p>

  <p>Though not a Manx man by birth, I can assure your correspondent <span

  of this country is still in existence, I may mention, that in the
  agricultural districts of Forfarshire, the Black Rat (<i>Mus rattus</i>)
  was in existence a few years ago. On pulling down the remains of an old
  farm-steading in 1823, after the building of a new one, they were there
  so numerous, that a greyhound I had destroyed no fewer than seventy-seven
  of them in the course of a couple of hours. Having used precautions
  against their lodgment in the new steading, under the floors, and on the
  tops of the party walls, they were effectually banished from the
  farm.</p>

  <i>The Common Accidence Improved</i>, by the Rev. Edward Owen, Rector of
  Warrington, and for fifty years Master of the Grammar School founded in
  that town, under the will of Sir Thomas Boteler, on April 27, 1526. I
  believe it was first published in 1770, but the copy now before me is of
  an edition printed in 1800; and the Preface contains a promise (I know
  not whether afterwards fulfilled) of the early publication of the rules,
  versified on the plan of Busbey and Ruddiman, under the title of
  <i>Elementa Latina Metrica</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">J. F. M.</p>

  <p><i>Warville</i> (Vol. viii., p. 516.).&mdash;As regards the letter
  <i>W</i>, there is a distinction to be made between proper names and
  other words in the French language. The exclusion of that letter from the
  alphabet is sufficient proof that there are no words of French origin
  that begin with it; but the proper names in which it figures are common
  enough in recent times. Of these, the greater number have been imported
  from the neighbouring countries of Germany, Switzerland, and <!-- Page
  210 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>{210}</span>Belgium:
  and some too are of local origin or formation.</p>

  <p>In the latter category is the name of <i>Warville</i>, which is
  derived from Ouarville, near Chartres, where Brissot was born in 1754.
  Between the French <i>ouar</i> and our "war," there is a close similarity
  of sound; and in the spirit of innovation, which characterised the age of
  Brissot, the transition was a matter of easy accomplishment. Hence the
  <i>nom de guerre</i> of Warville, by which he was known to his
  cotemporaries.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p><i>The Camden Society</i> has just issued a volume of domestic
  letters, which contain much curious illustration of the stirring times to
  which they refer. The volume is entitled <i>Letters of the Lady Brilliana
  Harley, wife of Sir Robert Harley, of Brampton Bryan, Knight of the Bath,
  with Introduction and Notes</i>, by the Rev. T.&nbsp;T. Lewis. The writer,
  Lady Brilliana, was a daughter of Sir Edward Conway, afterwards Baron
  Conway, and is supposed to have been born whilst her father was
  Lieut.-Governor of the "Brill." The earlier letters (1625-1633) are
  addressed to her husband, the remainder (1638-1643) to her son Edward,
  during his residence at Oxford. The appendix contains several documents
  of considerable historical interest.</p>

  <p><i>Elements of Jurisprudence</i>, by C. J. Foster, M.A., Professor of
  Jurisprudence at University College, London, is an able and well-written
  endeavour to settle the principles upon which law is to be founded.
  Believing that law is capable of scientific reduction, Professor Foster
  has in this little work attempted, and with great ability, to show the
  principles upon which he thinks it must be so reduced.</p>

  <p>Mr. Croker has reprinted from <i>The Times</i> his correspondence with
  Lord John Russell on some passages of Moore's <i>Diary</i>. In the
  postscript which he has added, explanatory of Mr. Moore's acquaintance
  and correspondence with him, Mr. Croker convicts Moore, by passages from
  his own letters, of writing very fulsomely <i>to</i> Mr. Croker, at the
  same time that he was writing very sneeringly <i>of</i> him.</p>

<h2>Notices to Correspondents.</h2>

  <p>F. T. <i>The characteristic description of</i> The Weekly Pacquet,
  <i>by the author of the continuation of Sir James Mackintosh's</i>
  History of England, <i>seems perfectly just. We had marked for quotation,
  as a sample of its virulent tone, "The Ceremony and Manner of Baptizing
  Antichrist," in No. 6., p. 47.; but we found its ribaldry would occupy
  too much of our valuable space, and after all would perhaps not elicit
  one Protestant clap of applause even at Exeter Hall.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">John Weston.</span> <i>The insertion of paginal
  figures to the Advertisement pages of "N. &amp; Q." was considered at the
  time the change was made, when it was hinted to us that many of our
  subscribers would wish to retain those pages. We may probably dispense
  them in our next Volume.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Foreigner.</span> <i>The Canon inquired after will be
  found to be the 18th of the "Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiastical,
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1603." Its partial observance complained
  of by our Correspondent has been of late years frequently discussed in
  the various Church periodicals and newspapers, especially in the</i>
  British Magazine, vols. xviii., xix., <i>and</i> xx. <i>See also the
  official judgment of the Bishop of London on this Canon in his</i> Charge
